# Quick Start Guide

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Run automated setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

OR manually:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download model
mkdir models
wget https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf -O models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf
```

## 2. Launch Network

```bash
python network.py
```

You should see:
```
✓ Network launched successfully with 6 nodes
```

## 3. Submit Task

In another terminal:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python submit_task.py "Create a function to reverse a string"
```

## Expected Output

```
RESULT RECEIVED
Generated by node: abc123

CODE:
------------------------------------------------------------
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Troubleshooting

**Import error for hivemind?**
```bash
pip install hivemind --upgrade
```

**Docker permission denied?**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then log out and back in
```

**Model not found?**
- Check `models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf` exists
- Verify path in `config.py` matches

**No nodes discovered?**
- Wait 10-15 seconds after launching network
- Check firewall isn't blocking local connections

## Next Steps

Try more complex tasks:
```bash
python submit_task.py "Build a React todo list component"
python submit_task.py "Create a FastAPI endpoint for user registration"
python submit_task.py "Write a binary search algorithm with tests"
```

The network will automatically decompose complex tasks and distribute them!
