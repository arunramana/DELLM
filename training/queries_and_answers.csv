Query,Answer
"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It uses algorithms that improve their performance through experience."
"How does photosynthesis work?","Plants convert light energy into chemical energy by absorbing sunlight through chlorophyll. Carbon dioxide and water are transformed into glucose and oxygen through this process."
"What causes earthquakes?","Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates in Earth's crust suddenly shift or break, releasing stored energy. This energy travels through the Earth as seismic waves, causing ground shaking."
"Why is the sky blue?","Sunlight scatters in Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths scattering more than other colors. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue."
"What is blockchain technology?","Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in blocks linked chronologically. Each block contains encrypted data and cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks."
"How do vaccines work?","Vaccines introduce a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen to train the immune system to recognize and fight it. This creates immunity without causing the actual disease."
"What is climate change?","Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. It results in rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruption."
"How does the internet work?","The internet connects billions of devices through a network of networks using standardized protocols like TCP/IP. Data is broken into packets and routed through various servers to reach its destination."
"What is DNA?","DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries genetic instructions for all living organisms. It consists of two strands forming a double helix structure with base pairs encoding hereditary information."
"Why do we sleep?","Sleep allows the body to repair tissues, consolidate memories, and regulate hormones essential for health. It also clears metabolic waste from the brain and restores energy for daily functioning."
"What is quantum computing?","Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits. This enables them to solve certain complex problems exponentially faster than traditional computers."
"How does GPS work?","GPS uses satellites orbiting Earth that transmit signals to receivers on the ground. By calculating the time delay from multiple satellites, the receiver determines its precise location through trilateration."
"What causes inflation?","Inflation occurs when the general price level of goods and services increases over time, reducing purchasing power. It's typically caused by increased demand, rising production costs, or expanded money supply."
"How do antibiotics work?","Antibiotics kill bacteria or prevent their growth by targeting specific bacterial structures or processes not found in human cells. They work through mechanisms like disrupting cell wall synthesis or protein production."
"What is artificial intelligence?","AI refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. It encompasses techniques like machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing."
